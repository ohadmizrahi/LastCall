Architecture & Design
The platform employs an n-tier architecture, ensuring separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability. Here's a breakdown:

Presentation Layer: Handles the UI and user interactions. It presents data to the user and interprets the user's commands.
Business Logic Layer: Also known as the service layer, it contains the business logic, rules, and algorithms. It acts as an intermediary between the presentation and data layer.
Data Access Layer: This is where data is accessed from data sources like databases. It includes the code that makes CRUD operations possible.
Data Layer: Consists of databases and other sources of data.
Coupled with the n-tier architecture, the platform is designed following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. This ensures further separation between the user interface, the business logic, and the data:

Model: Represents the data structures and the business logic.
View: Displays the data, the user interface of the application.
Controller: Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.
